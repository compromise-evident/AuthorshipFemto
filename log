Version 1.0.1   Added continue; in  else() for non-character detection upon user
                message entry otherwise  m += 9;  is last before re-detect. This
                is only an issue if your cat helps you type during modification.
                Caution: if this else() is encountered in v1 the event continues
                with shifted number & message--voiding the verif after this one.
                Don't forget, you can always  publish  multiple numbers at once.
             -> NOTHING MAJOR,  ALL FILES COMPATIBLE,  USE THIS VERSION AT WILL.
